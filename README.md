# Project 1 - *TipCalculator*

**Note: Use iPhone 11 and iOS 13.5. Auto Layout Constraints not implemented.**

**TipCalculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Nikesh Subedi**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Better UI
- [ ] Idle timer to show random tipping facts to encourage/promote tipping

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Auto Constraint Layouts were hard to figure out. I also tried (and failed) to implement a idle timer that would help me know that the user was done entering the bill amount so that I could animate a random fact about tipping.
